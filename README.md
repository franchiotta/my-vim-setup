Setup for VIM editor
--------------------

Personal configuration to setup vim in your machine.

**Installation steps**

* git clone git@github.com:franchiotta/my-vim-setup.git ~/.vim
* cd ~/.vim
* ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

**Recomendations**
As this bundle comes with different packages pre-installed such as command-t, you need to make sure your vim installation is compatible with all those dependencies. Consider to read the documentation for each installed pluging (Vundle is used as pluging manager).
